# modest-css

Modest-CSS is built from Skeleton CSS and uses some common SASS functionality to deliver a simple, lightweight and highly customizable framework.

This framework is a great starting point for a project which doesn't need more then the most commonly styled HTML elements.

## Requirements

| Prerequisite    | How to check | How to install
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Node.js 0.12.x  | `node -v`    | [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/) |
| gulp >= 3.8.10  | `gulp -v`    | `npm install -g gulp` |
| Bower >= 1.3.12 | `bower -v`   | `npm install -g bower` |


## Framework Installation
* Clone the repo to your local machine: `git clone`

### Install gulp and Bower

Building the css requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/). We recommend you update to the latest version of npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`.

From the command line:

1. Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) globally with `npm install -g gulp bower`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `bower install`

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

### Available gulp commands

* `gulp` — Compile and optimize the files in your dist directory
* `gulp watch` — Launches Browsersync, and compile assets when file changes are made
